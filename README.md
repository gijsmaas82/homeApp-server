# Home Project

This is an ongoing project for home use and under constant construction. It is the backend for my personal home app. Check out the readme and the deployed website here [Home App Client](https://github.com/gijsmaas82/homeApp-client)


### Features

* Express and Sequelize
* PostgresQL and Docker
* Heroku
* Jsonwebtoken

### Express and Sequelize

I use express to make a server listen to events conforming to the principals of a Rest API of getting, posting, updating and deleting information from my back-end. I use Sequelize to make queries to my database 

### PostgresQL and Docker

I use docker to make a container specified for use with PostgresQL as my query language to interact with the database. 

### Heroku

After checking if everything works on my localhost I deploy the backend using Heroku.

### Jsonwebtoken

To validate users on my website i sent them a jsonwebtoken after logging in to verify if a user is allowed to use certain features of my website.
